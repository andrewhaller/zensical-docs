# New project

You can create a new project from the command line using the `zensical new`
command. It requires a path as an argument that specifies where the new project
is to be created. If the path does not yet exist, it will be created for you.

## Usage

```sh
zensical new [OPTIONS] PROJECT_DIRECTORY
```

The directory structure created within the project directory consists of:

```sh
.
├─ .github/
├─ docs/
│  ├─ index.md
│  └─ markdown.md
└─ zensical.toml
```

- The `zensical.toml` file serves as the project's configuration and can be
customized following the instructions in the [setup guides].

- The `docs` directory contains your documentation's sources. The provided
  `index.md` and `markdown.md` files are included as starting points. The
  directory can be changed via [`docs_dir`][docs_dir]

- The `.github` folder contains a GitHub Actions workflow that helps to
  automatically build and [publish your documentation] site to [GitHub Pages].
  You can modify the workflow to suit your own CI/CD needs, or remove the folder
  entirly if you use a different platform.

[setup guides]: ../setup/basics.md
[docs_dir]: ../setup/basics.md#docs_dir
[publish your documentation]: ../publish-your-site.md
[GitHub Pages]: ../publish-your-site.md#github-pages

## Options

You can run `zensical new --help` to get command-line help for the `new`
command. Apart from this, the `new` command does not have any additional
options at the moment.
