# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for authoring text such as technical
documentation, blog posts, etc. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber, with
help from Aaron Swartz. Compared to alternatives like HTML or XML, it is easy to
write and read, using a lean and intuitive syntax.

Zensical uses [Python Markdown] for compatibility with Material for MkDocs.
Python Markdown aims to be a faithful and extensible port of [John
Gruber's original Markdown syntax][gruber]. For the most part, it is fully compatible
with the original specification, supporting the core features like headings,
lists, links, blockquotes, and inline formatting (e.g., bold and italics).

Both Python Markdown itself and the [Python Markdown Extensions] that Zensical
also supports provide extensions to the core Markdown language to cater for the
needs of technical writers who want to produce clear, compelling, and visually
attractive documentation.

Supporting the same syntax for content is a key component in our approach to
ensure compatibility with Material for MkDocs and to then evolve Zensical from
that point of departure. See [our roadmap] and [compatibility pages] for details.

!!! info "Future development"
    We are currently actively exploring the possibility of adding support for
    [CommonMark] with GitHub-flavored Markdown extensions as well as extended
    authoring options using a component system.

    Moving away from a Python-based Markdown implementation will also offer
    significant performance advantages and improve tooling support as CommonMark
    has much wider adoption than Python Markdown.

    We will provide migration paths that will allow you to migrate your content
    to CommonMark when Zensical's support for it has matured and when your team
    is ready to migrate.

## Learning Markdown

The [original description of Markdown][gruber] by John Gruber is still a good
starting point if you are unfamiliar with Markdown syntax. The [Markdown Guide]
is another great resource.

## Linking between pages

When adding links to other pages always use related links to the corresponding
Markdown files instead of linking to the HTML that will be produced. Zensical
will translate them to the correct links to the target. Crucially, it will
produce the correct link to an HTML file or a link ending with a directory if
[`use_directory_urls`][dirurls] is being used.

[dirurls]: ../setup/basics.md#use_directory_urls

In the future, Zensical will support output formats other than HTML and when
this happens, links that point to the Markdown pages will still work, while
links entered into the content that point directly to a HTML page will not.

Also, when using relative links, your site can move to a new `site_url` without
any changes. Resist the urge to use absolute links. Absolute links may work on
your local machine but may break on a production server.

## Page title

Zensical produces a page title for each page. It uses, in order of priority:

1. a title defined for the page in the `nav` configuration setting.
2. a title defined in the front-matter of the page.
3. a first-level Markdown header in the page content
4. the base name of the Markdown file

So, explicitly defined navigation takes the highest priority, followed by an
explicitly defined page title, followed by a title derived from the first level
one Markdown header. If none of these are available, the filename is used as a
fallback.

!!! info "Future developments"
    Note that the order of priority defined above ensures compatibility with
    MkDocs. We are reviewing the handling of page titles in the context of our
    [work on navigation within Zensical Spark].

    In particular, we are looking to preserve markup in the title, which MkDocs
    strips out, making workarounds necessary in the typeset plugin of Material
    for MkDocs to re-create a title that preserves markup.

    Any re-design will include migration paths that avoid costly re-work.
