# Front matter

Zensical supports the inclusion of metadata in the front matter of a Markdown
file that is stripped from the file contents before the rest of the content is
handed over to the Markdown parser. It can be used in templates to customize
rendering per-page.

## Page title

This property overrides the page title in the navigation and in the `title` tag:

``` yaml
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
---

# Page title
...
```

[page icon]: #page-icon
[page status]: #page-status
[head]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head

## Page description

A Markdown file can include a description that is added to the HTML head `meta`
tags of a page:

``` yaml
---
description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor.
---

# Page title
...
```

[site_description]: ../setup/basics.md#site_description

## Page icon

Each page can define an icon that is displayed in the navigation, which must
come from any of the [included icon sets]:

``` yaml
---
icon: lucide/braces
---

# Page title
...
```

[included icon sets]: icons-emojis.md#included-icon-sets

## Page status

A status can be assigned to each page, which is then displayed as part of the
navigation sidebar. First, associate a status identifier with a description by
adding the following to your configuration::

=== "`zensical.toml`"

    ``` toml
    [project.extra.status]
    <identifier>: "<description>"
    ```

=== "`mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    extra:
      status:
        <identifier>: <description>
    ```

The identifier can only include alphanumeric characters, as well as dashes
 and underscores. For example, if you have a status `Recently added`, you can
 set `new` as an identifier:

=== "`zensical.toml`"

    ``` toml
    [project.extra.status]
    new = "Recently added"
    ```
=== "`mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    extra:
      status:
        new: Recently added
    ```

The page status can now be set with the front matter `status` property. For
example, you can mark a page as `new` with the following lines at the top of a
Markdown file:

``` yaml
---
status: new
---

# Page title
...
```

The following status identifiers are already defined:

- :lucide-badge-alert: – `new`
- :lucide-trash: – `deprecated`

You can define a custom page status this way but if you want it to
have an icon other than the default one you need to also configure
that in your [`extra.css`][extra_css].

[extra_css]: ../customization.md#additional-css

## Page template

You can use the `template` metadata attribute to set a [custom template] for a
page, which will be used instead of the default `main.html`. Note that you need
to place the template you want to use in your [overrides directory], which needs
to be configured before you can use it.

[custom template]: ../customization.md#custom-templates
[overrides directory]: ../customization.md#configuring-overrides

For example, to apply the `my_homepage.html` template to the page:

``` yaml
---
template: my_homepage.html
---

# Page title
...
```

## Hide sidebars

Zensical allows you to hide elements of a page such as the navigation sidebar
and the table of contents:

``` yaml
---
hide:
    - navigation
    - toc
---

# Page title
...
```

See the section on [hiding sidebars] in the navigation setup guide for more
details.

[hiding sidebars]: ../setup/navigation.md#hide-the-sidebars

## Customization

### Use in templates

You can add further custom data to the front matter and use it in your [template
overrides] or [custom templates]. A common use case is to add metadata to the
HTML `head`. Say you want to control whether a page is indexed by search engines
by adding a [meta robots `nofollow` tag][nofollow].

[template overrides]: ../customization.md/#template-overrides
[custom templates]: ../customization.md#custom-templates
[nofollow]: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag
[block override]: ../customization.md#overriding-blocks

The first thing you would need to do is to copy `main.html` to your [overrides
directory] and add a [block override] for the `extrahead` block that adds a
robots meta tag:

``` html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block extrahead %}
  {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.robots %}
    <meta name="robots" content="{{ page.meta.robots }}" />
  {% else %}
    <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

Note that the block override uses an `else` branch to set a default when the
page metadata does not specify a value. Now, you can specify the robots meta
tag content from the page header:

``` yaml
---
robots: noindex, nofollow
---

# Page title
...
```

### Use in plugins

Material for MkDocs plugins such as the tag plugin, the social plugin and the
blog plugin also make extensive use of page metadata. As Zensical approaches
[feature parity] with Material for MkDocs, we will be adding modules that
implement equivalent functionality and that make use of metadata.
